Movie Gigs
Movie Gigs is a web-based application that allows users to watch movies, web series, and anime for free. It is inspired by Netflix, but it does not require any subscription or payment. Users can browse and search for various genres and categories of video content, and enjoy them on their devices.

Features
    Responsive and user-friendly interface
    Free and unlimited access to video content
    Support for multiple languages and subtitles
    Ability to create and manage playlists
    Option to rate and review the videos
    Dark and light mode themes

  
Technologies
Movie Gigs is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the following frameworks and libraries:

talewind: for creating responsive and mobile-first layouts
jQuery: for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling
Font Awesome: for adding icons and fonts
Video.js: for creating and customizing the video player

Installation
Moviegigs does not require any installation or download. You can access it online by clicking on this (https://shivamtalukdar.github.io/moviegigs/#). You can also use a live server extension or tool to launch the application from your code editor.

Contribution
Movie Gigs is a personal project that I created to practice my web development skills and showcase my creativity. I am the sole developer and maintainer of this project. However, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports from other developers or users. You can contact me through my GitHub profile or email me at 

Limitations
Movie Gigs is not a fully-fledged streaming service, and it has some limitations and drawbacks. For example:

    The video content is not updated regularly, and it depends on the availability of the sources
    The video quality and speed may vary depending on the network and device
    The application does not have any authentication or security features
    
Future Improvements
Movie Gigs is a work in progress, and I plan to make some improvements and enhancements in the future. Some of the features that I intend to add are:

A database and backend system to store and manage the video content and user data
A login and registration system to allow users to create and access their accounts
A recommendation system to suggest videos based on the userâ€™s preferences and history
A comment section to allow users to interact and share their opinions
A notification system to alert users about new releases and updates
I hope you enjoy using Movie Gigs, and I appreciate your support and feedback. Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. ðŸ˜Š
